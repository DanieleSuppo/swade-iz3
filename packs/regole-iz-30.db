This may happen either through a single Hacking roll, or a Dramatic Task if you are using that Plugin. The security ratings are based on the tier of the computer system, and are listed below:</p>\n<p>&bull; Tier 1: No penalty</p>\n<p>&bull; Tier 2: &minus;2 penalty</p>\n<p>&bull; Tier 3: &minus;4 penalty</p>\n<p>&bull; Tier 4: &minus;6 penalty</p>\n<p>&bull; Tier 5: &minus;8 penalty</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM</h3>\n<p>To manipulate the system in some fashion, you must use the appropriate skill for the task. As mentioned in the Passive Monitoring side bar, if the system is set to Passive Monitoring, there are no IDS penalties applied to these rolls as the character has already bypassed the system&rsquo;s encryption. Characters can manipulate the system in the following ways:</p>\n<p>&bull; Create a backdoor: Characters can create a back door in a computer system by making a Hacking (Programming) roll modified by the tier of the system&rsquo;s IDS. Success gives the character unfettered access to the system for 24 hours. The character must still make appropriate skill checks to perform other actions within the system, however.</p>\n<p>&bull; Datamine: Characters can make a Research roll to scan the system for specific files and other, similar types of data. This data may be downloaded/replaced or edited as an action. The time it takes to datamine is equal to one round plus a number of rounds equal to the tier of the computer system.</p>\n<p>&bull; Disable device: Characters can disable any device linked to the system with a successful Hacking skill check. At their discretion, game masters may require another skill be used instead of Hacking. For instance, safely shutting down a nuclear reactor might require the character to roll their Science skill. If your group is using the Cyber Hacking Plugin, shutting down a piece of Cybertech requires a Hacking(Programming) roll.</p>\n<p>&bull; Edit a file or device: Characters can edit a file or linked device by making a Hacking (Programming) skill check. The time it takes to datamine is equal to one round plus a number of rounds equal to the tier of the computer system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&bull; Operate a device: Characters may attempt to operate a device linked to the computer system, such as an elevator, an automated weapon system, a vehicle, etc. To do so, the character must have the appropriate skill.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}
