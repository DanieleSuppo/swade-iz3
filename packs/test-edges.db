This means a peek can be spotted by someone who knows what to look for; with a Notice roll opposing the zeek's Psionics roll. Since these powers affect the mind, some (like disguise or invisibility) won't register via electronic devices like cameras or IR gear.</p><p><b>Tweek Trappings:</b> Tweek powers are largely telekinetic in nature, and require the zeek to channel energy to her target. This means an active tweek must make some sort of motion to mimic the effect she's creating (such as\"pushing\" with her hands when firing off a burst), and regardless, the kinetic\"ripples\" can be seen (sort of like the air above hot pavement) with a raise on a Notice roll.</p><p><b>Freek Trappings:</b> Freek powers are.. strange. They defy classification (although some skirt the boundaries of peek and tweek powers). In all cases, their use is very noticeable, things like glowing eyes for darksight, or glowing hands for healing, as are their effects. The bottom line is it doesn't even take a Notice roll to know when a freek is using her abilities or to spot her in a crowd while she's doing so. Note that anecdotal tales of\"holy people\" with halos and the like are probably records of freeks in action.</p><p><b>Backlash:</b> As Psionicists per the Savage Worlds core rules</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"isArcaneBackground":true,"requirements":{"value":""}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[]}
